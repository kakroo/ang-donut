ng new ang-donut --create-application=false   -- Create a workspace. THis will be empty
ng g library donut --prefix=ng   -- this will be our library where the code will reside
ng g application donut-test    --this will be the tester for our library

To run it we need to do the following
ng serve donut-test  -- cz the library cant be served(can't it)

Now we want to test run our library, 
we need to use it in our test app, before that we need to build our library

ng build donut  --this will create a build version of our library under dist folder

Now we import it like a regular node module in donut-test, this is important
